# tilers
A Rust-based map tile generator

## Description

This repository contains the Rust project that implements a map tile generator served through a web application.
The web application uses a single entry point to serve the tiles which contain traffic density data for the 
[Vehicle Energy Dataset](https://github.com/gsoh/VED).

## Usage

To launch the web application use the following command from the project's root:
```shell
cargo run --release
```

From a Jupyter Notebook, use the following code to show the map with overlayed tiles:
```Python
import folium
from folium.raster_layers import TileLayer

html_map = folium.Map(prefer_canvas=True, 
                      tiles="cartodbpositron", 
                      location=(42.274569, -83.733228), 
                      zoom_start=13)
tile_layer = TileLayer(tiles="http://127.0.0.1:8000/density/{x}/{y}/{z}", 
                       overlay=True,
                       attr="(C) JPF")
tile_layer.add_to(html_map)
html_map
```
